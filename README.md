**SneakerShip** is a dummy ecommerce application built using Kotlin and following MVVM Architecture.

**Screens**
1. Product Listings
2. Product Details
3. Cart

**Dependencies**
- GSON
- Glide
- Room
- Coroutines
- Hilt
- JUnit4
- Mockito

**Assumptions/Points to Note**
- All the products are statically stored and fetched in RemoteData.kt
- Used Room to manage cart items addition or removal
- For some reason, the images in the email seem to be broken and were not rendering so I managed to create a UI capturing all the requirements mentioned in the email
